								<p>I remember as a kid, I would build those game stations you see in arcades out of paper and duct tape, and I would even try to fit a game in there and link controls to it. Yes, it sounds absurd doesn’t it? But I believed I could do it, and hey, it worked out (I think). This is how intense I was in trying to understand how things that I enjoyed using work. I am literally obsessed with solving problems. The thrill of putting my knowledge to good use to solve a problem that people are struggling with really gets me going! It feels awesome! This is who I feel I will be for the rest of my career. I spent the last four years of my life studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, but growing up I was always obsessed with computers and software products. Consequently, learning about these things became somewhat of a hobby while simultaneously progressing towards my degree. As of now, I have decided to pursue what excites me and get a second degree in Computer Science this fall. Do I regret my decision studying my first degree? Absolutely not! If anything, it’s a plus.</p>

								<p>Imagine building
									software that mimick the way human beings make decisions? That's so exciting! This is exactly what AI is to me. If you want to know more about my take on this subject and what got me interested in this area and other things, you can head over to “My Thoughts” section. With this passion, I took the initiative to enroll in and complete quite a number of online courses bootcamps in various areas of development such as Web Development, iOS Mobile Development, Machine Learning and Neural Networks, etc., while thinking of how to incorporate Artificial Intelligence into software. This is one area that is intriguing to me and I want to learn more about.  <br />
								  As someone who was born in Abuja, Nigeria, I wasn't blessed with having abundance of technology around me besides at my home. It's crazy how far behind Nigeria, as well as other third-world countries, is in terms of technological advancements.
								  This is something else that motivates me because despite all that, I still see what I am passionate about to be meant for me, you know? It is my dream that I can one day give back everything that I learn from here on out to these countries that are not as privileged. The reason being not just because I feel like I owe it to them, but because sharing knowledge is something I love to do as I journey through life.
								  I mean, who wouldn't love to have cheat codes when playing this game called "Life", right? </p>
