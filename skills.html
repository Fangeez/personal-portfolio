								<h1>HOW MIGHT I USE THESE SKILLS TO HELP YOU?</h1>
								<p>It's easy to say I have them, but what can I do with them?</p>
								<dl>
									<dt>HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>If you have needs for front-end development work, I got you! These three skills will allow me to build amazing responsive websites and web apps. I would take your design needs and make them a reality through code.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Node.js</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>I will use Node.js (with express.js) to take care of your back-end web development needs like implementing certain functionality and maintaining servers. I can be the ghost writer to your one hit wonder!</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Python</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Python gives me the platform to incorporate Machine Learning into whatever technological solutions you might have to a problem. Also, it allows me to manipulate your data
											for certain uses, and for general data structure/algorithm implementation uses. Possibly, I could also use it for your backend Web Development needs as seen fit.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Swift</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>If you have any needs for native iOS mobile development, I can help you with that. Not only will I write/maintain code for the functionality, I will also
										design the UI and UX in XCode. I'm no Hannah Montana, but I sure can give you the best of both worlds!</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Mongo DB</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>If you use non-relational databases, I'm your guy. I can also use the command-line interface to interact with your database as it deems fit for your applications as I have experience with Mongoose. Not the animal of course haha.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>C++</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>For your general software engineering needs, I can use C++ to handle that</p>

								<h2>IBM BLUEHACK HACKATHON 2019</h2>
								<h2>"Syn-Lang"</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ibm.JPG" alt="" /></span>On the 27th of October, 2019, I participated in a two-day BlueHack Hackathon hosted by IBM and Amerisource Bergen. We were tasked with coming up with a solution
								to solve one problem of our choice in the health industry. My team and I came up with a mobile application called "Syn-Lang"(Sign Language Synthesizer and Translator). This application would incorporate Deep Learning to recognize human hands gesturing American Sign Language and convert
							  them to English text. We made use of the TensorFlow library in Python, and used the Keras framework to design the neural network that is responsible for the decision making. The prototype for the mobile application was designed using React Native, and
							  this idea was pitched to mentors and executives of both companies within 5 minutes with the aid of a powerpoint presentation. Not only did we technically design this app, but we
								proposed an extensive and viable business model to go with it to make sure it would be sustainable in the market. This earned us <strong>1st Place</strong> in the competition out of over 20 teams, with each of us earning a $500 Visa gift card. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience because
								nothing matches the thrill of working with people in a time crunch. Funny part is, I had never met my teammates prior to the event. How crazy is that?

									 <h2>COV-FIGURES Mobile App</h2>
								
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cov-figures.png" alt="" /></span> It was an unprecedented time due to the COVID-19, and it seemed that a lot of people were put in an emergency state of mind - hearing news from different sources and not knowing who to trust. My friend and I decided to come up with a solution to help people in this 
									time of need. If there was a way that people could conveniently get access to relevant information on the COVID-19 situation, we figured it would really help put peoples' minds at ease. With that being said, we decided to both build a cross-platform mobile application called "Cov-Figures" using Flutter (a cross-platform mobile app development tool built by Google). This app would takre real-time COVID-19 data such as confirmed deaths, new cases, confirmed cases, etc. from a select API based on the user's location down to the county level. The user would also be able 
									to observe the situation of other locations within the US. We took advantage of Flutter's widget catalog to build and implement the UI of the app. The back-end functionality was built on the user-side because this would be a small-scale app with a limited number of statistics being provided. The entire process of planning to development to optimization/testing took us about three weeks, with most of the time spent on researching to find a very reliable and trusted API for the source of our data. So much time was spent on this becasue of the nature of the data being provided being sensitive.
									Unfortunately, the deployment process to the App store and Play store was halted due to regulations against individual developers releasing apps giving sensitive health information as opposed to recognized enterprises. As heartbreaking as this was after working so hard,
									it was all about the journey of taking something from a mere idea to a working product that we can be proud of. The link to the Github can be found <a href="#">here.</a> You could also test it out for yourself as long as you have Flutter and Android Studio installed on your computer.

								<h2>Simon-Says Web Game Application</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/simonsays.png" alt="" /></span>When I began learning about Web Development, I enrolled in one of the highest rated Web-Development bootcamps on Udemy taught by Angela Yu. Halfway through the course, I decided to apply my knowledge
								of CSS, JQuery and Vanilla JS to a project. I decided to create a game that is based on the popular game "Simon Says". If you're not familiar with the game, you basically have to memorize a randomly generated sequence pattern by the computer and replicate that pattern.
							  The sequence starts from one and gets longer each turn. The moment one of your selection is out of place, you lose the game and start over. If you're someone that loves to see how much memory power your brain has, this is for you! You could click the <a href="https://fangeez.github.io/Simon-Says-Web-Game-Application/" target="_blank">demo here</a> to see how it works. You could also check it out on my Github. </p>

								<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rh6nFBkbtl3Y9Lh1-zpCKspY-4uazNj1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><img src = "images/TicTacToe.png" alt = ""/></a></span>I built a simple tic-tac-toe game with Python. The output and gameplay of this program was purely Python, and the visuals are gotten by the way I manipulated output symbols. This could have been improved by using the PyGame library
									, but I wanted to get creative with my knowledge of Python data structures. A sample video is provided on the image link to the left to see a playthrough of the game. It's to be played with a friend. A future improvement I will make to this program will be to incorporate reinforcement learning so in case you have no friends,
									you can still have fun by playing with the AI :)
									 </p>
									 <h2>Quizzler Mobile App</h2>
	 								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Quizzler.png" alt="" /></span> I love game shows like Jeopardy, so I thought to myself "Why not use your knowledge in Swift to build an app like that?". So I did; hence, Quizzler. I used the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern to implement this. A series of question prompts displays to the user and the user simply answers "True" or "False". I also incorporated a progress bar that keeps
									track of how far into you are into the questions, as well as a score tracker that keeps track of your score. I took the time to add some elevator background music :)) so you feel relaxed while answering the questions, and finally animations/sounds for the correct or incorrect selections.</p>
